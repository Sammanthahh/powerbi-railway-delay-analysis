# UK Train Delays – Power BI Analysis

This Power BI project explores delays in the London railway system and their financial impact using interactive dashboards. The analysis is based on train departure data from King’s Cross Station in April 2023.

## 📊 Project Overview

The railway industry is a critical part of UK public transport. According to Statista (2024), “In the fiscal year 2023/24, Transport for London reported nearly 3.6 billion passenger journeys across its services.” With such high usage, train delays present serious financial and operational challenges.

This project visualises and analyses key trends in:
- Train delay frequencies
- Delay durations by time and day
- Root causes of delays
- Financial losses related to compensation

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Power BI** for data visualisation and dashboard creation
- **Excel** for minor data cleaning
- Dataset: Train departures from King’s Cross, April 2023

## 🎯 Goal
Provide actionable insights to help transport authorities:
- Identify delay trends
- Reduce operational inefficiencies
- Minimise costs due to delays
